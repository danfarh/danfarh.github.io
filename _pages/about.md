About me
======
Hi! I have completed my computer engineering B.Sc with a GPA of 3.88 out of 4 at the <b>[University of Tehran](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-tehran)</b> under supervision of [Prof. Kazim Fouladi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YLOcZDUAAAAJ&hl=en). During my studies, I became familiar with several areas of artificial intelligence, including <b>machine learning</b>, <b>deep learning</b>, and <b>natural language processing</b>. I completed a range of practical projects such as chatbots, text summarization, search engines, news classification, and sentiment snalysis. These experiences not only improved my technical skills but also taught me how to approach and solve real‑world problems. My B.Sc. final project focused on building a dialogue system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and a Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to deliver context‑aware, conversational AI experiences.
